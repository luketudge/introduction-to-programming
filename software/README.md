# Software

To get the most out of the class, you should have some software installed on your own computer so that you can try out the exercises at home.

## Essentials

### Python 3

The main programming language that we will learn about is Python 3. You will need to install it. The easiest way to do this on the most common operating systems (Windows, macOS, or Linux), is to install a program called Anaconda. Anaconda is a 'distribution' of various related pieces of software used in data science. Anaconda installs these separate pieces of software and provides a convenient environment in which to organize, update, and add to them.

Download the installer for the Python 3 version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The page should detect your operating system automatically, but otherwise click on the relevant tab for Windows, macOS, or Linux. Additional installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

One thing that can occasionally cause problems for Anaconda is the name of the user account on your computer. If your username contains spaces or non-English characters (for example *ä* or *ß* or something in Arabic, or Devanagari, etc.), then Anaconda may have trouble understanding which directory your files are stored in. If you encounter error messages about paths or filenames, you could try creating a new user account on your computer with a username that contains only basic English characters and no spaces. Switch to this account before installing and running Anaconda.

If you are using a popular distribution of Linux such as Ubuntu, Python 3 will already be installed on your computer. You can still install Anaconda if you wish, but you do not need to, and it may be easier to install the few remaining extras via your Linux package manager rather than via Anaconda. Instructions for doing so are provided [here](linux.md).

### Spyder

Python programs are just text files, so we can (and occasionally will) create them in a normal text editor. But this is tedious. An alternative is to use an 'Integrated Development Environment' (IDE). An IDE is like a text editor for writing computer programs, and provides many useful extra features such as automatically checking for mistakes in the program, and allowing us to run our program immediately to check whether it functions correctly.

There are many IDEs available for Python. For beginners I recommend [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Spyder is included by default in Anaconda, so if you have installed Anaconda you do not need to do anything more in order to get it. The user guide for Anaconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) shows how to launch Spyder from Anaconda.

Once you have launched Spyder, there are a few highly recommended configuration steps that you should carry out in order to be able to follow the class smoothly. These are described [here](spyder.md).

## Extras

### Database browser

When we come to work with SQL databases, it will be convenient to have a program that can display the contents of a database. The DB Browser for SQLite is a simple program available for all the major operating systems. You can download it [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).

### QT Designer
