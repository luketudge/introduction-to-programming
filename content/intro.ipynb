    "# Creating a computer program with Python\n",

    "## Computer programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is a sequence of instructions for a computer. Ultimately, these instructions take the form of numbers, each of which refers to one action that the computer can take. But in modern computer programming we rarely have to concern ourselves directly with this 'machine code'. Instead, modern computer programs begin their lives simply as one or more text files. These text files are entirely like any other text file; they contain human-readable characters, and have no special properties in themselves. We can open them in a normal text editor like Notepad.\n",
    "\n",
    "An intermediate step is required in order to run these text files as a program. There are different ways in which this intermediate step can be accomplished. Python, the programming language that we will learn, works via an intermediate computer program called the [interpreter](extras/glossary.ipynb#interpreter). The Python interpreter reads the lines of a text file one by one, turns them into instructions for the computer, and gets the computer to execute those instructions immediately. The interpreter program does its work by applying a particular set of rules to the contents of the text file, rules that convert text commands into computer commands. It is this set of rules that constitutes a particular programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computer programs are organized as a collection of multiple such text files, each containing instructions for one aspect of the program's capabilities. There may be one or two main files that represent the starting point of the program, and these main files then refer to others. In addition, the program may include non-text files containing data needed by the program, such as images, sounds, database files, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click [here](https://github.com/metabrainz/picard) to see an example of a fairly complex computer program organized as a collection of files. This program, called [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/), allows a user to tag music files with information about the artist, song name, album, etc. Take a look at just one file in the program, called [album.py](https://github.com/metabrainz/picard/blob/master/picard/album.py). This is a text file containing instructions written in Python. Its contents are not easily understandable at a first glance, even for an experienced programmer, but notice that it does at least contain some instructions that take the form of everyday English words, such as `from`, `for`, and `if`. It also contains some preamble detailing the license information for the program, which is completely intelligible to a normal human being (or at least to a lawyer). Further down, the contents become too complex to understand by skim reading, but we may notice some regularities. For example, this file seems to refer to other files in the overall program (note a reference to [config.py](https://github.com/metabrainz/picard/blob/master/picard/config.py) on [line 33](https://github.com/metabrainz/picard/blob/64c4153801ed418c11033ad73981f7209b9cbf63/picard/album.py#L33)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't create any programs that are as complex as Picard, which is the result of several programmers collaborating over a fairly long period of time. However, our programs will have approximately the same structure; they will be collections of text files containing instructions written according to the rules of the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python computer program can be as simple as a single file. This is what we will start with. Try opening up Notepad or your favorite text editor, and typing into it the Python command below. Make sure that you use a pure text editor like Notepad and not a word processor like Microsoft Word, because a word processor may not be able to save plain text or may insert additional unwanted content into a text file."

    "The second new feature in *greeting.py* is the [inline comment](extras/glossary.ipynb#comment) on [line 8](examples/greeting.py#L8). This line is clearly not a Python command. It is instead written in plain English. Python will ignore any text that follows a hash symbol `#`. This allows us to use this symbol to introduce human-readable explanations of the workings of our program. In such a simple program as this, the comment on line 8 is somewhat superfluous; the command on the following line is clear enough on its own. However, as a beginner you should get into the habit of writing comments for most of the Python commands that you put into your program. This helps you to focus and remember how you created your programs, and helps others understand what you did or where you went wrong if your program doesn't work as you expected. Later when you have more experience you can save explanatory comments just for those sections of your program that are too complex to understand at a first glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, on [line 6](examples/greeting.py#L6) we see an example of another use of comments: to make a 'note to self' of what still needs to be added to the program. It is conventional to mark such comments with the text `TODO`. Here we have noted that we would like to make the greeting personal by asking the user to type in their name. This is what the next example program achieves.\n",

To finish your program and continue editing it or working on other programs, you must first let your running program finish. In this case, you can achieve this by doing as the program asks and typing in your name at the console where the input prompt is displayed.\n",

    "(Alternatively, if you get stuck with a program running and you just want to break off, you can stop it by clicking on the red 'stop' icon. You should then see that the 'stop' icon is no longer red, and that the console once again displays something like `In [...]:` ready for the next program to run. Yet another alternative for stopping a running program is to press the key combination *ctrl* + *c*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have seen that *greeting_personal.py* responded with a greeting containing whatever name you typed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this program work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicity of the Python language makes it fairly easy to understand what is going on here. The program begins by using another [built-in](extras/glossary.ipynb#builtin) Python function on [line 9](examples/greeting_personal.py#L9). Unlike the `print()` function that we saw in the preceding example, the `input()` function [returns](extras/glossary.ipynb#return) some output. The output in this case is whatever piece of text the user types at the console. If we want to use the output of a function in our Python program we must [assign](extras/glossary.ipynb#assignment) it into a [variable](extras/glossary.ipynb#variable). The equals symbol `=` takes whatever output is generated on the right hand side and stores it under whatever name we have put on the left hand side. The name is then available for the rest of the program. Wherever we use this name in the remainder of the program, it stands for the contents that we assigned into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important things to note about assigning variables. You can explore why these things are important by making some modifications to *greeting_personal.py* and checking their effects when you run the modified version of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike in math, the two sides of an equation with `=` are not interchangeable. Instead, the result of the command on the right is first worked out (or [evaluated](extras/glossary.ipynb#evaluate)) and then assigned into the name on the left. (Try swapping the two sides of the `=` command on [line 9](examples/greeting_personal.py#L9)).\n",
    "* The order of lines in a Python program matters. Python runs each line in turn. So if our program uses a variable, that variable must be assigned *above* the line on which it is used. (Try placing [line 16](examples/greeting_personal.py#L16) at the top of the program file instead of at the bottom).\n",
    "* We can use almost any name we like for a variable. We need only be consistent in using that same name throughout our program. (Try replacing both occurrences of the variable `name` with something arbitrary like `x` or `y`).\n",
    "* There are however some limitations on valid variable names in Python. For example, they can contain numbers but cannot begin with a number (try replacing both occurrences of the variable `name` with either `name1` or `1name`), and they cannot contain spaces because Python would interpret this as the names of two separate variables (try replacing `name` with `my name`).\n",
    "* It is possible to use the name of a built-in function (such as `print` or `input`) as a variable name in Python, but this is not a good idea as it will temporarily overwrite the function and prevent us from using it in the remainder of our program. (Try replacing both occurrences of the variable `name` with `print`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we should avoid choosing abstract variable names like `x` and try always to choose a variable name that describes the intended contents of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at [line 13](examples/greeting_personal.py#L13) of *greeting_personal.py*. This line also assigns a new variable, called `message`. But in this case what is assigned is not the result of a function but an expression involving an [operator](extras/glossary.ipynb#operator), the `+` symbol. When used with two pieces of text, the `+` operator just sticks them together as one ([concatenates](extras/glossary.ipynb#concatenate) them). So this line creates a new piece of text with *Hello* and then whatever name the user typed in at the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the text `'Hello '`  is enclosed in quote marks, but the variable `name` is not. This is important. *Hello* is not a variable but simply literal text, so it must be in quote marks. In contrast, `name` *is* a variable and so it should not be enclosed in quote marks. To check your understanding, try to predict what the program would do if `name` on line 13 were enclosed in quote marks, then make the change and run this new version of the program to check whether you were right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the workings of [line 16](examples/greeting_personal.py#L16) should be clear if you have understood everything we have covered up to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using an IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just introduced the basic workings of Python programs using a few simple examples. We have been editing and running these programs in the Spyder [IDE](extras/glossary.ipynb#ide). Let's finish by looking at a few tips for working with Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The editor\n",
    "\n",
    "The pane where you can edit and run Python programs is the editor. As we have seen, it is essentially just a text editor. But it adds a few useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already have noticed that the Spyder editor performs some basic checks of your program even before you run it. Small icons along the left margin of the editing pane highlight parts of the program that might require our attention. For example in the screenshot below we are being warned about a mistake on line 9 and reminded of a *TODO* note that we made for ourselves on line 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/editor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spyder also has an autocomplete feature. If you are typing a new part of your program, you can begin typing something, then press the tab key (↹) and the Spyder editor will attempt to autocomplete the word that you are typing. This works if you are typing the name of a Python [built-in function](extras/glossary.ipynb#builtin), or of a [variable](extras/glossary.ipynb#variable) that you have defined elsewhere in your program. This feature can save you a lot of typing errors once you start working with many different functions or with variables that have long names.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as running your whole program, Spyder allows you to run just parts of it. You can do this by highlighting the lines that you would like to run (or if it is just a single line then placing the cursor on this line is enough) and then selecting **Run selection or current line** from the **Run** menu. There is also a keyboard shortcut for this, which on most systems is *F9*. This feature is useful if you have written a new part or modified one part of your program and you want to test it in isolation. But don't be tempted to test your whole program this way, by selecting one section after another and running them in turn. Always test your program by running it as a whole via the 'run' icon. This ensures that you are really testing the whole program as a self-contained unit, which is also how your program's users will run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The console\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already encountered the console as the place where any printouts or interactions with our program occur once it is run. But there is more to the console than this. We can also type single Python commands into the console, and they will be sent to the Python interpreter and run immediately, as if they were part of a program. Try it out: go to the console, and where it is waiting with `In [...]:` type in a Python command (for example to print something out with `print()`) and press return. You should see the result, and then the `In [...]:` prompt will return, waiting for the next command.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to bear in mind this distinction between the editor and the console. Notice that when we type new lines into a text file that is open in the editor, those lines are not run and we do not see their effects anywhere. Nothing that we type into the editor has any effect until we save the changes and run the text file as a Python program. By contrast, whatever we type into the console is run as soon as we finish typing and press return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The console also 'remembers' what we have typed so far. For example, if you type `age = 37` into the console and press return, and then type `age + 1`, the console remembers that the first command defined a variable called `age` and will use whatever value we assigned into it if we use this same variable name in subsequent commands. We can therefore use the console to test out and explore Python's behavior. A common working pattern if you are working on a new task as a Python beginner is to try various commands in the console first and check how they work (or whether they work at all), and then once you have found out what you need to know you switch to the editor and incorporate the new commands into whatever program you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few shortcuts for working with the console too. If you want to get back a command that you typed previously, put your cursor in the console and press the up arrow key (⬆). You should see again the last command that you entered. You can edit this command if you wish, and then run it again by pressing return. If you press the up arrow key repeatedly, you can search through all the commands that you have entered so far. These commands are also stored under the **History log** tab in Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shortcut *Ctrl* + *l* will clear away any output that is currently in the console. It isn't especially necessary to do this, but if you are tidy-minded it can help make things clearer if you have lots of printouts left over in the console and you wish to start afresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, you can also erase the console's 'memory' of previous commands. This is a more useful feature. For example, if you would like to test out something completely new, you do not want to accidentally refer to variables that you have defined in previous commands while you were testing out something else. To 'reset' the console type in the command `%reset`. You will be prompted to confirm that you really want to delete all the variables you have defined so far:"
