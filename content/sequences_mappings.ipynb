A floor is the part of the building immediately *above* the actual physical platform that divides the building into vertical sections.

    "\n",
    "We will see dictionaries in several example programs later on. That is enough about them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing a data representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know about sequences and dictionaries, we have quite a few options when it comes to deciding how to represent data in our programs. For example, if we have some data about customers, we could hold them in a tuple, in a list, in a dictionary that maps customer IDs to their information, or in some combination of these types, such as a list containing multiple dictionaries, or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some basic guidelines when choosing how to represent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple or list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are [mutable](extras/glossary.md#mutability), whereas tuples are not. For basic purposes, this is really the only important consideration when choosing between these two types. If we want to represent a sequence of values that is defined only once in our program and is then set in stone, then we should choose a tuple. If the values will need to be changed, reordered, or added to, then we should choose a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why we should ever bother with tuples at all. If a list is like a tuple but can be changed more easily, why not just keep our options open and always choose lists over tuples? Never underestimate your own (and your collaborators') capacity to make small mistakes. If you need to define a sequence of values in your program and you know that those values should not change during one run of your program, then you can play it safe and store them in a tuple. This makes it less likely that some command that you put into your program inadvertently changes the tuple without your being aware of it. It also signals to other people reading your program that these values are not intended to change during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of such 'fixed parameters' might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The (*x*, *y*) dimensions of a static image or dialog window.\n",
    "* A small collection of known valid words.\n",
    "* The (*width*, *height*, *depth*) of items of mahogany furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List or dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw above that a dictionary has [keys](extras/glossary.md#key), which allow us to retrieve the stored values using a name instead of a position. So we should choose a dictionary to represent a collection of items of information each of which has a meaning or label. For example, demographic information about a single user. On the other hand, we should choose a list if all the items in a collection represent instances of the same thing without unique labels. For example multiple user names.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also differences in how fast a computer can carry out certain operations on a list or a dictionary. This may become an important consideration in big programs that have to process a lot of data quickly. But this is a topic for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested data representations\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all our examples of tuples, lists, and dictionaries have contained strings or numbers. But they can also contain other tuples, lists, and dictionaries. For example, we might have a dictionary of lists, in which each [key](extras/glossary.md#key) is a description of a piece of information about customers, and each value is a list storing that piece of information for all customers in the same order.\n",
