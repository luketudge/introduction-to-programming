    "When we start to write 'real' programs that other people will actually want to use, we will need to clean up our act a bit and adopt a more organized way of working. In particular, if we have to collaborate with other programmers, there are some important things that we will need to organize to avoid getting into a sticky mess:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A [repository](extras/glossary.md#repository)**. We would like a single central location where the current version of our program is stored and available to others, instead of just storing our program on our own computer and emailing it to people then emailing them again when we correct a mistake and then emailing them a third time when we forget the attachment.\n",
    "* **[Version control](extras/glossary.md#versioning)**. We would also like to keep track of different versions of our program. We may need to work on some changes provisionally, until we are confident that they are correct, or we may need to undo some changes once we discover that they have completely broken everything.\n",
    "* **Documentation**. We should organize and make available some documents that explain to others how to use our program or how it works. Ideally these should be a little bit prettier than just plain text [docstrings](extras/glossary.md#docstring).\n",
    "* **Communication**. We would like to provide our users and collaborators with a channel through which they can notify us of all the embarrassing mistakes that they have discovered in the program, or request unnecessarily complex new features that they would urgently like the program to have.\n",
    "* **Delegation**. We may eventually be lucky enough to have assistants or kind mentors helping us write the program. We should let them know clearly what their tasks are (and are not).\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/about) is a web platform that makes all of these things possible. We can store our computer programs on the GitHub website, track successive versions as we make changes, add attractive documentation, get notifications from others who comment on our project, and so on. GitHub isn't the only platform that provides these services, but it is one of the most widely used, and is relatively easy to navigate. In this lesson we will learn the basics of using GitHub to manage our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version control\n",
    "\n",
    "'Version control', or simply 'versioning', broadly refers to the practice of tracking multiple versions of something. That something needn't especially be a computer program. You have probably practiced version control at some point with an essay or thesis that you wrote at college, creating a series of documents called *thesis_v2.docx*, *thesis_v3.docx*, *thesis_final.docx*, *thesis_final_adviser_corrections.docx*, *thesis_really_final.docx*, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But version control is particularly important for computer programs, in part because they often span more than a single file (for example a main [script](extras/glossary.md#script) along with one or more [modules](extras/glossary.md#module)), and in part because they are fragile; small mistakes can break them entirely, and changes need to be carefully tested to make sure that they are compatible with existing parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, version control for computer programs is often automated; a version control program monitors our changes continuously in the background, records them, and later allows us to undo or redo them in various combinations. An automated version control program is essential to any moderately large programming project. Imagine the hassle and the mistakes you could make if you had to manually name and store all the separate versions of all the files in your computer program in the same way as you do for a college thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### git\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various automatic version control programs available, but by far the most widely used is called *git*. git is a program that monitors changes to groups of files and records those changes, allowing us to review, undo, and revise them.\n",
    "\n",
    "git and GitHub are two separate things, but they work together. git is a program on our computer that does the job of recording our changes locally and offline, whereas GitHub is a website on which to store the records that a git program makes. In a very loose analogy, you can think of git as being like a word processor program with a 'track changes' feature, and GitHub as being the equivalent of Dropbox or GoogleDrive, where you can store and view those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to follow along with the examples in this lesson, you will need both an online account at the GitHub site (it's free and you can sign up [here](https://github.com/join)) and you will need to have git installed on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In case you are wondering why git is called the way it is, there are a few speculations [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Naming).)\n",
