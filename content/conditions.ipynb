We would now like to give the flow of our programs a branching structure, such that its behavior will vary depending on the circumstances. This can be achieved with [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control): lines of our program that do not on their own produce any result, but instead control when (or how often, or in what variations) other lines are run.\n",

    "That covers the very basics of logical statements in Python. Before we see how to turn logical statements into conditions for carrying out a part of a our program, let's take a brief detour to consider a slight quirk in the way Python handles the boolean data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that some data types can be converted into others, using [built-in](extras/glossary.md#builtin) functions that have the same names as the type we wish to convert to (for example `int()` for converting to integer, and `str()` for converting to string). Initially, it may seem strange to allow converting other types into booleans, since booleans are always just `True` or `False`. Is the integer `42` on its own a 'true' number or a 'false' number? What about a string like `'JavaScript is a terrible programming language.'`? (Of course, some strings may contain true statements, but Python can't be expected to work this out.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, Python does allow us to convert other data types to boolean. How does it decide whether numbers or strings are 'true' or not? If you feel like a challenge, you might like to head to the Spyder console now and try converting a few strings and numbers to boolean (the type conversion function is `bool()`) to see whether you can discover the pattern.\n",
