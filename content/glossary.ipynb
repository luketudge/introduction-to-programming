    "* You are more likely to find the answers to your programming questions in internet searches if you formulate your search using the right terms.\n",
    "* The answers you find in internet searches will mostly be written using these terms.\n",
    "* Once you start working in programming, you will need to talk about the workings of your programs with other programmers.\n",

In Python, aliases occur most commonly when [importing](#import) [modules](#module). A module can be imported under an alias instead of under its normal name, using the `as` [keyword](#keyword). We might do this in order to make it quicker to type the name of the module later, or simply as a matter of convention. For example, numpy is often imported under the alias 'np':"

The administrators of the Paris metro's website may provide a structured method by which other applications can access its data. Such a method is termed an 'Application Programming Interface' (API). The makers of other apps can then use the rules of the API to submit requests for information, and these requests will be answered in a particular format according to the rules of the API.\n",

If we want to store text in a computer, we need some way of allocating each text character a unique number, so that when we read the text data, we turn the stored numbers back into the correct characters. A system for allocating a unique number to each character is known as a 'text encoding'. If we need to transfer text data from one computer to another, we need to make sure that the computer reading the data uses the same encoding for reading as the computer that wrote the data used for writing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different text encodings, but the two most important ones to be aware of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). This system is universally agreed upon and standard across all normal computers, but it only covers the English alphabet. We cannot use ASCII for non-English characters such as `'à'` or for Devanagari, Sinhalese, emojis, etc.\n",
    "* [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). This system includes many symbols in many writing systems and is by far the most widely-used on the internet. It is also usually the default encoding on Linux [operating systems](#os). For characters that are defined in the ASCII encoding, UTF-8 uses the same system as ASCII, so for these characters the two encodings are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some [operating systems](#os), most notably Windows and macOS, do not always use UTF-8 by default to encode non-ASCII characters. They may instead use a variety of other encodings with names like 'Latin-1', 'ISO-8859', or 'Windows-1252'. Some of these are equivalent for certain subsets of characters, and only become incompatible for a few obscure characters, such as special kinds of quote mark. And to add yet more to the confusion, these various non-UTF-8 encodings are frequently given the wrong name, even in official places such as the documentation for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## error\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes our program fails and cannot be completed, either because we have not written the program according to the allowed [syntax](#syntax) or because an [exception](#exception) occurs that our program cannot handle. In this case, our program will stop running and Python will display a message with some information about the 'error' that occurred. Any parts of the program that follow the occurrence of the error will not be carried out.\n",

    "\n",
    "To evaluate a command or expression means to 'work out' its result. So the result of evaluating the Python expression `round(1.618 * 2)` is `3`. The Python interpreter first evaluates `1.618 * 2` and gets `3.236`, then evaluates `round(3.236)` and gets `3`. We sometimes say that a certain expression 'evaluates to' its result. So for example `round(1.618 * 2)` evaluates to `3`, and `2 + 2 == 5` evaluates to `False`.\n",

These things are not necessarily fatal for our program, but need to be dealt with in order for our program to continue running as normal. Example exceptions include unexpected input from the user (such as entering a word when our program expects a number), or trying to open a file that has been moved or deleted. When an exception occurs, we say that our program has '[raised](#raise)' an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python distinguishes among various different kinds of exception. Some of the most common ones that we are likely to encounter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NameError`: We have tried to use a [variable](#variable), but no variable with that name has been [assigned](#assignment) yet.\n",
    "* `IndexError`: We have used an [index](#index) that goes beyond the length of whatever we are trying to apply the index to (e.g. a [list](#list)).\n",
    "* `ValueError`: We have supplied an invalid input [value](#value) to a [function](#function).\n",
    "* `TypeError`: We have tried to do something with a particular [data type](#type), but that thing only works for a different data type.\n",
    "* `FileNotFoundError`: We have tried to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can handle exceptions with a [control statement](#control) that instructs Python to 'try' one action, but to carry out a different action if the first action raises an exception. For example:"
