    "One minor disadvantage of the csv format may already strike you when you look at the first few rows above: There is a lot of repetition in this file. The first few songs are all from the album 'Agents of Fortune'. In order to associate all these songs with this album and its year of release, there is really no alternative to just repeating the same album information on every row to which it applies. Likewise, the first few albums are all by the legendary rock band 'Blue Öyster Cult', so the name and country of the band must be repeated over many rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This format, in which the complete set of information for each observation is contained on every row, even if this means repeating the same combinations of values many times, is sometimes known in data analysis as the 'long format'. Its great advantage is that it ensures that each row is self-contained and complete; one row gives all the information we need about that observation. One of its disadvantages is inefficiency; if the file contains many observations, it will contain a lot of redundant text, taking up storage space unnecessarily, and making it computationally slower to load the file and search in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid repeating text unnecessarily, we need multiple tables. We need separate tables for songs, albums, and artists, so that each row in each of these tables contains the information for just one unique song, album, or artist. For each song, we could then just refer to the relevant row in the 'albums' or 'artists' tables when we need this extra information, rather than repeating it throughout the 'songs' table. The repetitive columns in the 'songs' table would be replaced by a single 'album' column that just notes which album in the 'albums' table that song belongs to. Ideally, this 'linking' column should contain compact abbreviations, such as ID numbers for the albums, rather than the full album names.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having trouble imagining what such a data file would look like, just consider the 'sheets' functionality of a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. Most spreadsheet programs allow for multiple tables in the same file, each table stored in a separate sheet. Take a look at the example file [songs.xlsx](examples/data/songs.xlsx). We will load the separate sheets in this file into Python in a moment, but to get an overview of the file's structure it is probably easier to just open it in your preferred spreadsheet program, like Excel or OpenOffice.\n",

    "The basic principle here is that integer row IDs 'relate' the rows in one table to those in one or more other tables. This general concept of multiple linked tables is often called a 'relational database', and it is well suited to cases in which the data have a certain hierarchical or interconnected structure. In our case, we have a hierarchical structure in which songs are grouped within albums, which are grouped within artists.\n",

    "A relational database provides a tidy, efficient way of storing more complex data. However, when we actually come to view the data and work with them, we will often need to 'reunite' the information from multiple tables and get back to a 'long format' table, at least temporarily. For example, we might want to see a table of all the albums by artists from the UK. Since the artists' country of origin is contained in the artists table, we need to put this table together with the albums table before we can select albums by country.\n",

Most programmers who work with relational databases would be horrified at the suggestion of using a Microsoft Excel file as a database. Justifiably so.

There is also one more very desirable feature of a database that neither an Excel spreadsheet nor the collection of [dataframes](glossary.ipynb#dataframe) stored in it fulfills.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, we could just try to make sure that we and our colleagues don't make this kind of mistake when working with the database. But we are human beings; trying hard not to make mistakes doesn't usually work out too well for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would really like from a good database is for it to be a little more than just an inert place of storage. As well as storing our data, it should also store and enforce a set of logical rules that describe how our data are organized. We can then rely on the database to alert us when we accidentally break one of our own rules. Rules about what constitutes a valid entry for a database are often termed 'constraints'.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example task, we would like to be able to set the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every artist name must be unique (i.e. no duplicate artists).\n",
    "* Every combination of artist and album must be unique (i.e. so that duplicate album names are allowed if they are by different artists, but not the same album for the same artist).\n",
    "* The name of a song must be unique within the album (i.e. no duplicate songs on the same album).\n",
    "* The number of a song must be unique within the album (i.e. not two first songs or two second songs on the same album).\n",
    "* Every artist ID in the albums table must have a corresponding row in the artists table.\n",
    "* Every album ID in the songs table must have a corresponding row in the albums table.\n",

    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a 'proper' relational database that doesn't just store multiple related tables but also implements constraints on their relations, we need to move on from spreadsheets and dataframes. In fact, we need to learn a little bit of a completely new programming language, one that is designed specially for working with relational databases. [SQL](glossary.ipynb#SQL) (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that is very widely used in database management.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL provides commands that are broadly of three different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the relations and constraints that give a database its structure.\n",
    "* Modify the data in a database, for example by inserting, deleting, or changing information.\n",
    "* Fetch different combinations of information from a database (usually called 'querying' the database).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pronunciation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people like to pronounce 'SQL' as 'sequel'. But other less imaginative people, like me, have always just pronounced it by spelling out the letters, 'es queue ell'. Say it however you like and don't let cool people snub you for not saying 'sequel'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DB Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now learn a bit of SQL. We will work our way up to creating our target database, but let's first take a quick look at one I made earlier, so that we know what we are aiming for. You can find it in the file [songs.db](examples/data/songs.db). You may of course wonder how to even open this file. There are a number of ways to interact with an SQL-compatible database file. One of those is of course by running SQL commands, as we will see shortly. But there are also programs that can display database contents in a friendlier clickable interface. The best basic one is the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). It is free to download. If you would like, you can install it and then use it to open up our example database file. You should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/db_browser.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'Database Structure' view lists the tables in the database. Along with each table, you can see the SQL commands that set the structure and constraints of the table. You might already be able to work out what some of this means. SQL is a fairly human-readable programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn about these commands in a moment. For now, just explore the DB Browser app. You can browse the individual tables from the 'Browse Data' tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/db_browser_browse.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch between tables using the drop-down menu, and take a look at the albums table. You will see that it has an 'artist_id' column that refers to the 'id' column in the artists table. Likewise, the songs table has an 'album_id' column that refers to the 'id' column in the albums table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also edit the database from the 'Browse Data' tab, via the 'New Record' button. Try this out. A new row will appear, in which you can enter values, much as in a normal spreadsheet. However, note that if you enter something that violates one of the constraints of the database, you will be suitably admonished:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/db_browser_unique.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! The database has got us covered if we make stupid mistakes. If you want to see what the warning looks like for one of the other constraints, go to the albums table and try to add an album with an artistID that is not in the artists table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that nothing you do in the browser will alter the database unless you click the 'Write Changes' button. If you would like to erase any temporary changes you have made in the browser, you can click the 'Revert Changes' button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/db_browser_write_revert.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, take a look at the 'Execute SQL' tab. This tab provides a text field where you can enter SQL commands, run them, and see the results. Try typing in the following command, and then press the 'Play' (▶) button (we will learn what this command means in a moment):\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT album, year FROM albums;`\n",
    "\n",
    "Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/db_browser_select.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining SQL examples, I will abandon the DB browser and instead show how to run SQL commands from within a Python program. You can follow along in Python or if you prefer, you can try some of the SQL commands out in the DB browser 'Execute SQL' tab instead. However, the database file does not appreciate being open both in Python and in the DB Browser, since this could lead to conflicting edits, so you will need to use only one or the other at any one time.\n",

    "### sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we need to [import](glossary.ipynb#import) an additional module for our task.  There are a few third-party [packages](glossary.ipynb#package) that enable us to work with SQL from Python. Some of these are very good, but I will instead show here a very simple one that is already part of the Python [standard library](standard_library.ipynb), called `sqlite3`. This module provides a fairly limited set of functions, and its use mostly involves just sending SQL commands to the database. This simplicity will allow us to focus on learning SQL without introducing too much additional Python complexity."
