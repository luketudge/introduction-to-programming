On the one hand, it allows for some concise intuitive commands, such as using `+` to combine strings or `*` to repeat them. But on the other hand, it means that we can occasionally make some big mistakes in our programs without immediately becoming aware of it. For example, if we found that `street_number` had been entered incorrectly and in fact needed an extra zero adding to it, then we might be tempted to multiply it by 10 in order to achieve this. Python would give no warning and would go ahead with what we asked even though the result is not what we want.

    "Some string methods are a bit to complex for us at this stage. Try the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `capitalize()`\n",
    "* `count()`\n",
    "* `endswith()`\n",
    "* `find()`\n",
    "* `index()` (Note the subtle difference from `find()`.)\n",
    "* `lower()`\n",
    "* `lstrip()`\n",
    "* `replace()`\n",
    "* `rstrip()`\n",
    "* `split()`\n",

    "If you are feeling adventurous you can just try these out and see whether you can work out what they do. If so, make sure to test them with a variety of different strings to check that you have really understood their behavior. If you would like to check or need some help with examples, you can google *Python string method x* or you can read the full documentation for Python's string methods [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look now at just one more string method together, because it is a very useful one, but whose use is not completely straightforward. The `format()` method can be used to insert the values of other variables into certain positions in a string. This is particularly useful for preparing neat printouts for the users of our programs."
