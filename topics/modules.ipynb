    "In the [previous lesson](functions.ipynb) we learned how to define our own functions. I mentioned the possibility of re-using functions in a different file from the file in which the functions are defined. This is the main thing that we will learn about in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may reasonably ask why we would want to do this. If we are writing a program that requires one or more custom-defined functions, why not just define them in the same file that contains the program? This is the way that the [fun_facts.py](examples/fun_facts.py) example program works. For a simple program like *fun_facts.py*, this is fine, and is less complicated than splitting the functions and the commands that use them into separate files. But separating functions off from the rest of the program has some advantages for larger programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clarity**. One file shows the algorithmic workings of each component of the program, but another shows how those components are combined to create the overall program structure. We know which file to go to if we want to change one or the other.\n",
    "* **Portability**. A file that contains only functions can be re-used by a different program. The alternative, copying and pasting the function definition wherever it is needed, is prone to mistakes and makes our programs inflexible ('[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)').\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python file that contains an actual program that will 'do something' when run is often termed a [script](extras/glossary.md#script), because it is providing the Python [interpreter](extras/glossary.md#interpreter) with line-by-line instructions telling it what to do, like the script for an actor. A file that instead contains only function definitions (and possibly also some variables) intended to be used elsewhere is often termed a [module](extras/glossary.md#module). A basic structure for a simple multi-file Python program is to have one module file providing some functions, and a script file, the 'main' file, that gets those functions and actually does something with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works, using the [initials.py](examples/initials.py) file that we saw in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",

    "In fact, we can almost already create a multi-file program given what we have learned so far. We know how to define functions, we know how to use functions, and we know how to use additional [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control) to determine what actions are taken when, how often, and so on. The only missing ingredient is how to 'get' the contents of one file into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fairly easy. The [keyword](extras/glossary.md#keyword) `import` runs a Python file and then makes its contents (i.e. any functions or variables in it) available in the current file. The [syntax](extras/glossary.md#syntax) for importing the contents of a file is simply to write `import` followed by the name of the file, without the *.py* file extension.\n",

By keeping imported things in a separate namespace, such accidental overwrites are avoided. It is entirely possible to import a module (for example called *my_module.py*) containing a function or variable called `x` and also to have something called `x` in your main program. The former will be available as `my_module.x` whereas the latter will be available simply as `x`.\n",
