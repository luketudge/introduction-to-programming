    "# Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous lesson](conditions.ipynb) we learned about [control statements](extras/glossary.md#control): lines of our program that do not themselves accomplish any action, but instead control something about when other lines of our program are run. That is, they determine the 'flow' of the program. We focused on 'conditional' control statements, which set a condition according to which further lines of the program are either run or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways in which we might want to control the flow of our program. For example, we might want to run a certain line more than once, maybe many times, or even indefinitely until a certain goal is achieved. Repeating lines of our program is sometimes termed '[iteration](extras/glossary.md#iterable)'. This is what we will learn about now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, let's structure our learning by working towards a simple toy program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**guess_the_animal.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make the computer 'think' of an animal (i.e. store the name of an animal in a variable).\n",
    "* Present the user with a series of six hints about the animal's identity.\n",
    "* For each hint, print it out and then ask the user to guess the animal.\n",
    "  * Allow them to give up by typing 'q'.\n",
    "  * If they just enter nothing, ask them again.\n",
    "  * If they get the answer right, stop the game and congratulate them\n",
    "  * If they get the answer wrong, continue to the next hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some branching in this program too, so we will need to use the techniques from the previous lesson. The novel aspect is the fact that there is some repetition; we need to get and process user input at least six times. Of course, for just six repetitions, we could achieve this by just copying and pasting the same lines into our program six times over. But achieving repetition by literally writing the same lines over an over is a bad idea, for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clarity**. It makes our program unnecessarily long and difficult for others to read.\n",
    "* **Robustness**. We can easily make small mistakes while copying, pasting, and modifying the repeated lines. This may break our program.\n",
    "* **Flexibility**. If we later decide that we would like to change some aspect of the repeated actions, we must change it in multiple places in our program. This is laborious, and may again introduce mistakes if we forget to make the change in one of the repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we should try to avoid repeating ourselves. This principle is so fundamental that there is a commonly-used acronym [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) that people use to remind each other of it. The opposite of a 'DRY' programming style is sometimes pejoratively termed a 'WET' programming style (variously either '**W**rite **E**verything **T**wice' or '**W**e **E**njoy **T**yping').\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of achieving repetition is to use a [sequence](extras/glossary.md#sequence). Remember that sequences are [data types](extras/glossary.md#type) that store multiple values in order, such as [tuples](extras/glossary.md#sequence) and [lists](extras/glossary.md#list). We have in fact already seen one way of performing an action repeatedly for each item in a sequence. Remember that list [comprehensions](extras/glossary.md#comprehension) create a new list by systematically applying the same action to all the items in another list, in order.\n",

For such cases, we need to group all the repeated actions together under a [control statement](extras/glossary.md#control) that instructs Python to repeat all of them. This pattern is known as a [loop](extras/glossary.md#loop). Here is a short example:"
